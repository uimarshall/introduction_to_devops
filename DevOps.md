# Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the intersection between the developers and operations.

This is how I installed Git on my windows.

- First I download git online
- Secondly I run the installation and follow the prompt.

Create a comprehensive documentation on the following subject matter

## The Concept of DevOps?

> What is DevOps?

In simple terms, Devops is a culture or practice which fills the gap between development team and the operations team.

In a wider context, DevOps is a software development methodology that integrates and automates processes between development and IT teams through a combination of cultural philosophies, tools and practices for the continuous integration and delivery of applications at a faster and more efficient rate.

> Benefits of DevOps

Successful DevOps adoption drives faster, more dependable software deployment and delivery,
increased operational efficiency and reduced security and compliance risks.

The benefits can be divided into 2 broad categories:

Technical benefits:

- Continuous software delivery
- Less complex problems to fix
- Faster resolution of problems

Business benefits:

- Faster delivery of features
- More stable operating environments
- More time available to add value (rather than fix/maintain)

> History of DevOps

The History of DevOps can be traced back to around 2007. Software developers voiced a need for a more streamlined and efficient software development model. The traditional software model, where developers who wrote code worked apart from operations who deployed and supported the code, supported siloed processes, which resulted in bottlenecks and delays. Under the traditional software development model, security was an afterthought rather than a vital step in the development process. Security breaches were dealt with after they had already taken place, as opposed to preventing them from happening in the first place. With the old software development model proving to be ineffective and the need for speed and a stronger focus on security, With the advent of DevOps, there was a fostering a shared responsibility and collaborative work culture, breaking down the traditional silos between development and operations teams. This seamless communication and collaboration lead to higher efficiency and productivity..

> DevOps Culture

DevOps encourages the culture of shared responsibility, collaboration and continuous improvement.

### SDLC (Software Development LifeCycle)

> The Concept of SDLC

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
The concept of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to the process of planning, developing, testing, and deploying software applications. It is a structured approach that aims to produce high-quality software that meets the demands of users.

> Why is it important for a DevOps Engineer?

SDLC involves the following phases: Planning, Designing, Building, Testing, Deploying and maintaining afterwards.

Having a clear Understanding of each phase of SDLC is important for DevOps Engineers as it provides a holistic view of the software development process. By doing so, It will help developers and operations teams work to improve collaboration, optimize processes, and ultimately, deliver better software applications.

> Where does DevOps fit in SDLC ?

DevOps fit into the Designing, Building, Testing, Deploying and maintenance phase of the SDLC.

> Can DevOps improve the SDLC Process?

DevOps can improve SDLC process through Automation and Orchestration.

Automation refers to the use of automated processes to reduce manual effort and speed up the delivery of services. It will in turn helps to streamline the software development process by automating mundane tasks like code reviews and deployment processes.

Orchestration breaks down complex tasks into simpler ones that are easier to manage.

The combination of Automation and Orchestration will improve SDLC by reducing manual intervention required from dev teams and allows them to focus on developing higher-quality code in less time,

As well as enabling dev teams to deploy applications quickly and reliably in various environments, such as staging or production.
